#Answers to the theoretical questions:

###1- What is a class?
A class is a blueprint for a category of things or objects having the same properties or having some properties in common.

###2- How does a class accomplish abstraction, encapsulation, and data hiding?
It accomplishes abstraction by describing the behaviour of the object using certain properties and functions. It also achieves encapsulation using data hiding as it uses Private section to hide the private data, and Public one to give access to the coder to edit the private data.

###3- What is the relationship between an object and a class?
The class is the blueprint for objects, so an object is an instance of the class.

###4- In what way, aside from being functions, are class function members different from class data members?
Functions are used to describe the behaviour of the class/object, they're by default **'Public'** members. So, they can be accessed outside the class.
But, data members are **'Private'** members, so they can be accessed only inside the class.
**Also**, the functions are responsible for any changes happen to the data members.
