#Answers to the theoretical questions:

###1- What is a class?
A class is a blueprint for a category of things or objects having the same properties or having some properties in common.

###2- How does a class accomplish abstraction, encapsulation, and data hiding?
It accomplishes abstraction by describing the behaviour of the object using certain properties and functions. It also achieves encapsulation using data hiding as it uses Private section to hide the private data, and Public one to give access to the coder to edit the private data.
